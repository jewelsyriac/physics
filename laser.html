        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p>LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Laser technology started with
            Albert
            Einstein in 1917, he has given theoretical basis for the development of Laser. The technology further
            evolved in
            1960 when the very first laser called Ruby Laser was built at Hughes Research Laboratoriesby T.H. Mainmann.
        </p>
        <section id="characteristics">
            <h1>Characteristics of Laser Radiation:</h1>
            <p>The laser beam has the following properties that distinguish it from an ordinary beam of light:</p>
            <ul>

                <p>
                    <li><b>Highly directional:</b> A conventional light source emits light in all directions. On the
                        other
                        hand,
                        Laser
                        emits
                        light only in one direction. The width of Laser beam is extremely narrow and hence a laser beam
                        can
                        travel
                        to
                        long distances without spreading. The directionality of laser beam is expressed in terms of
                        divergence:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li><b>Highly monochromatic:</b> A monochromatic source is a single frequency or single wavelength
                        source of
                        light.
                        The
                        laser light is more monochromatic than that of a convectional light source. This may be due to
                        the
                        stimulated
                        characteristic of laser light. The band width ( or wavelength spread) of convectional
                        monochromatic
                        light
                        source is 1000 Amstrongs. But the
                        band
                        width of ordinary light source is 10 Amstrongs.

                <h1>Ruby Laser</h1>
                <p>A ruby laser is a type of solid-state laser that uses a synthetic ruby crystal as the active medium.
                    The
                    active laser
                    medium is a synthetic ruby rod, which is typically a few centimeters long and a few millimeters in
                    diameter.</p>

                <h2>Construction</h2>
                <p>The ruby laser consists of three main parts: the ruby rod, the pumping source ( flash lamp), and the
                    optical resonator.
                    The ruby
                    rod is made of a synthetic ruby crystal, which is a type of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) that has been
                    doped
                    with chromium
                    ions (Cr3+).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="ruby-laser.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Ruby laser</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The Xenon flash lamp is used to excite the chromium ions in the ruby rod, causing them to emit light.
                </p>
                <p>The optical resonator is used to create a standing wave inside the ruby rod. This is done by
                    reflecting
                    the light
                    from the ruby rod back and forth between two mirrors, one of which is partially reflective. The
                    partially reflective
                    mirror allows some of the light to pass through and escape the resonator, creating the laser beam.
                </p>
                <h2>Working</h2>
                <p>When the flash lamp is activated, it pumps energy into the ruby rod, exciting the chromium ions. The
                    energy from the
                    flash lamp causes the atoms jump to a higher energy levels E3 and E4. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>The excited atoms from energy levels E4 and E3 falls to a metastable by a non-radiative transition.
                    From
                    this metastable state, atoms jumps to ground state by stimulated emission. This stimulated emission
                    results in laser emission of wavelength 694 nm.</p>
                <h5>Applications</h5>
                <p>The ruby laser can be used for a variety of applications, including materials processing, scientific
                    research, and
                    medical treatment. Due to its high power and the ability to produce pulses of light, it is often
                    used
                    for cutting
                    and welding materials, as well as for medical treatments such as skin resurfacing.</p>

                    ease of use.</p>
                <h3>Construction</h3>
                <p>The He-Ne laser consists of three main parts: the gas discharge tube, the pumping source, and the
                    optical
                    resonator.</p>
                <figure><img src="he-ne-laser.jpg">
                    <figcaption>He-Ne Laser</figcaption>
                </figure> The gas discharge tube contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressures, typically
                around
                a few torrs. The tube is sealed and contains two electrodes at either end.
                <p>The pumping source is used to excite the atoms in the gas mixture, causing them to emit light. This
                    is
                    typically
                    done using a high voltage electrical discharge, which is passed through the gas discharge tube
                    between
                    the two
                    electrodes. The electrical discharge causes the atoms in the gas mixture to become excited and emit
                    light.</p>
                <p>The optical resonator is used to create a standing wave inside the gas discharge tube. This is done
                    by
                    reflecting
                    the light from the tube back and forth between two mirrors, one of which is partially reflective.
                    The
                    partially
                    reflective mirror allows some of the light to pass through and escape the resonator, creating the
                    laser
                    beam.
                </p>
                <h3>Working</h3>
                When the electrical discharge is applied to the gas discharge tube, it excites Helium the atoms in the
                gas
                mixture. The energy
                from the electrical discharge causes the helium atoms to jump to higher energy levels F2 and F3 .
                <figure>
                    <img src="helium-neon-laser-working.png">
                    <figcaption>Energy level digram of He-Ne laser.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Since the energy levels of the He, F1 & F2 states are parallel ( or have same energy) to metastable
                    states of neon ( which are E6 & E4), collisions between these excited helium atoms and ground-state
                    neon
                    atoms
                    results in a selective and efficient transfer of excitation energy from the helium to neon. That
                    means
                    due to collision with He atoms, Ne atoms will jump to higher energy levels E6 & E4. </p>
                <p>The stimulated emission from E6 to E3 results in laser emission of 633 nm which is red.</p>
                <p> Other laser emission include IR emission due to transition from E6 to E5 ( 3.39 micrometer) and E4
                    to E3
                    with a wavelength of 1.15 micrometer.</p>

                    <h2>Semiconductor Laser</h2>
                    <p>A semiconductor laser, also known as a diode laser, is a type of laser that uses a semiconductor
                        as
                        the active
                        medium. It is a relatively small, low-powered laser that is widely used in a variety of
                        applications
                        due to its
                        compact size and low cost.</p>
                    <h3>Construction</h3>
                    <p>The semiconductor laser consists of two main parts: the active region and the p-n junction. The
                        active region is
                        made up of a thin layer of semiconductor material, typically made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) or
                        indium phosphide
                        (InP). This material is doped with impurities to create a p-type semiconductor on one side and
                        an
                        n-type
                        semiconductor on the other side.</p>
                    <figure><img src="semiconductor-laser.jpg">
                        <figcaption>Semiconductor Laser</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The p-n junction is created where the p-type and n-type semiconductors meet. When a forward-bias
                        voltage is
                        applied to the p-n junction, it creates a depletion region that acts as a waveguide for the
                        laser
                        light. The
                        active region is also surrounded by two mirrors, one of which is partially reflective, which
                        forms
                        the optical
                        resonator.</p>

                    <h3>Working</h3>
                    <p>The p-n junction of a semiconductor laser acts as a light-emitting diode. When a forward-bias
                        voltage
                        is applied
                        to the p-n junction, it creates a depletion region that acts as a waveguide for the laser light.
                        Electrons in
                        the n-type semiconductor recombine with holes in the p-type semiconductor, releasing energy in
                        the
                        form of
                        photons. These photons are then amplified and made coherent by the optical resonator, resulting
                        in a
                        laser beam.

                    </figure>
                    <p>The semiconductor laser can be operated in both continuous wave and pulsed mode, depending on the
                        application.
                        The wavelength of the laser light emitted by a semiconductor laser is determined by the
                        properties
                        of the
                        semiconductor material used in the active region.</p>
